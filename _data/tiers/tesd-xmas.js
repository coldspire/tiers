    _Tell 'Em Steve-Dave!_ is the only podcast I've listened to since it's inception. Since the podcast began back in 2011, that's a _lot_ of years of TESD listening. The pod puts out an annual Christmas special XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Tension-free due to the podcast album art featuring the TESD tattoo prominently, making the conclusion known before playing the first second.`,

          The banter is great, and the games are varied and competitive. Highlights include Bryan's, er, generous gift-giving and the motley combination of Sunday Jeff and Git-em stumbling to victory.`,

          The big minus for this episode is the reduction of Bry, simply due to the design of the show where each of the numerous participants have limited speaking times.`,

          I actually prefer the extra Declan-ordered bonus content to the official special, since the bonus content is just the core crew of three chatting through Christmas scenarios and traditions.`,

          Everything else, the 99% rest, is fairly typical TESD banter and games. Fine, sure, but it lacks the Christmas Special charm and elevation.`,
