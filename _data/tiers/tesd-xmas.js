          <li>Sal Vulcano guest-starring and fueling the antics</li>
          <li>The utter humiliation of the visiting team, who don't garner any points for most of the episode</li>
          <li>Ming meeting the theme of the rap challenge with a well-spoken friendly cooperative rap, and Bryan coming to the table with a very poorly delivered mean-spirited rap</li>
          <li>A live tattooing of the losing team leader</li>
          <li>The display of the tattoo on the podcast art, dispelling from the start any tension of whom the loser will be</li>
