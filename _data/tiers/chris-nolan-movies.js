          I saw this movie multiple times during its theatrical run in 2000. Prior to _Memento_ it was all the usual stuff, Michael Bay and whatever Will Smith was doing and whatever else you were supposed to watch as a movie-going teenager. But then, though I didn't know it at the time, _Memento_'s puzzle box of immaculate, clever filmmaking and storytelling was probably my gateway into smart arthouse movies. 
          
          All that and it's still a heck of a yarn to follow, with a cast of characters whose psyches balance on the edge of a ravine. Nolan's movies are all technically very competent, but only the best ones includes quality characterizations. _Memento_ has it all.

          One of my favorite action tropes is when a extraordinarily capable protagonist is made to work _really really_ hard to succeed, with the screws turned on them as hard as possible, just to see them sweat and exercise their experience.
          
          And boy does _The Dark Knight_ use a high-torque impact wrench on those screws. This movie has the Joker beat up on Batman so badly that the world's greatest detective seems hapless and fumbling. I mean, the Joker is so ahead of Batman that an ending where Batman actually triumphs seems unbelievable. (Of course, the plot does get there.)
          
          Unfortunately, the Two Face part of the movie feels like a forth act of a three-act play to me: it might be a complete arc, but it also feels like a lesser, rushed part of a greater movie. But even the lackluster fourth act can't diminish Heath Ledger's performance that provides us the greatest villain in all of movies. Yes, even better than Darth Vader and Liberty Valance.

          text: `Watching _Tenet_ didn't happen until well beyond it's released in the COVID-19-draped summer of 2020 for two reasons: the aforementioned COVID-19 outbreak, which, in a world which did not yet have vaccines for the epidemic, made going to a public movie theater about as appealing as floating face-down in a bubbling swamp; and because I'd heard the movie was an incomprehensible, unfollowable mess. Which, hey, those are pretty good reasons to avoid hitting the local multiplex for a movie, even if it's the latest by a favorite director.
          
          Jump ahead a couple years, and I figured that if I picked up _Tenet_ on Blu-ray, I could watch and re-watch bits as much as possible to understand what was going on. Or if it did turn out to be a muddling fiasco, I could ditch it entirely from the comfort of my own home, at least.
          
          The ranking speaks for itself: after a couple viewings, which did indeed involve multiple rewatches of key segments, _Tenet_ has become one of my favorite Nolan movies.`,

          text: `Just a couple years after the _The Dark Knight_, some friends and I saw _Inception_ in a full-size IMAX theater, and _whoa._ I recall this one being described as a art-house blockbuster, with its brainy high concept and big-money production and cast, and that description still sticks (and would stick for several of Nolan's pictures). Almost two hours of cerebral delight, played out with a web of complex but clear-cut rules, cracker-jack action sequences, and a whole lot of classy dressing up. I'm not even much of a DiCaprio fan, but I have to admit he makes it work here.
          
          I say two hours of delight... but the runtime of _Inception_ is nearly two-_and-a-half_ hours.

          title: "Interstellar",
          text: `I love the scope and science-based imagination of _Interstellar_, even if I barely understand the time- and mind-bending finale. Nolan is a brainy guy with an eye for the technical, and him tackling the material conceptualized by physicist Kip Thorn was a perfect match. (_Interstellar_ was originally supposed to be a Spielberg film. That would've been probably good for very different reasons.)
          
          What I don't love is a script that often feels contrived and clumsy, with whole sections of exposition, of both the human and cosmological kind, that feel stiff and obligatory. The example I remember the most is the fault of poor Anne Hathaway, who is otherwise fine in this movie, but who delivers a monologue about human love and attraction that is notable not for its life-affirming intent but how wooden and conspicuous it is. And then there's the tying-off of threads that reunites (in a way) father and daughter, a fundamental character finale that lands poorly, in a movie that otherwise lands dozens of complicated science-oriented concepts and plot points. There is a lot in _Interstellar_ that has little oomph.
          
          But in the end, I watch _Interstellar_ to see some cool happenings out in space, away from Earth, and watch humans struggle against literal time and tide(s), to which it delivers mightly. It has Matthew McConaughey delivering a warm, natural performance in the cold dead of space. It has robots that seem blocky and rigid but reveal complexity at just the right wondrous moments. And this movie has [one of my favorite action sequences of all time, the docking to the damaged _Endurance._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onVhbeY7nLM)`,
