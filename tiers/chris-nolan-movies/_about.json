  "text": "I saw Christopher Nolan\\s first movie, _Memento_, when it was released in theaters, way back in 2000. At the time, being a teenager who was mostly brought up on a diet of Michael Bay and ballsy brain-dead action and slight horror movies, _Memento_ was a flashbulb insight into what movies _could be_. I just really hadn't seen much like it.\n\nSeveral years pass, and I become part movie-nerd in my twenties. Nolan releases movie after movie, and _Memento_, which initially looked like a single spark of genius, turned out to be the beginning of a series of delightful brain-warmers. More years pass, and Nolan's hot streak to the present day is unbroken for me.\n\nAfter experiencing so many great Nolan movies, putting him on my own personal pantheon of favorite filmmakers was an easy choice."
