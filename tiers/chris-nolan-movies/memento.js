  I saw this movie multiple times during its theatrical run in 2000. Prior to _Memento_ it was all the usual stuff, Michael Bay and whatever Will Smith was doing and whatever else you were supposed to watch as a movie-going teenager. But then, though I didn't know it at the time, _Memento_'s puzzle box of immaculate, clever filmmaking and storytelling was probably my gateway into smart arthouse movies. 
  
  All that and it's still a heck of a yarn to follow, with a cast of characters whose psyches balance on the edge of a ravine. Nolan's movies are all technically very competent, but only the best ones includes quality characterizations. _Memento_ has it all.
