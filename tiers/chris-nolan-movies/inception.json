  "text": "Just a couple years after the _The Dark Knight_, some friends and I saw _Inception_ in a full-size IMAX theater, and _whoa._ I recall this one being described as a art-house blockbuster, with its brainy high concept and big-money production and cast, and that description still sticks (and would stick for several of Nolan's pictures). Almost two hours of cerebral delight, played out with a web of complex but clear-cut rules, cracker-jack action sequences, and a whole lot of classy dressing up. I'm not even much of a DiCaprio fan, but I have to admit he makes it work here.\n\nI say two hours of delight... but the runtime of _Inception_ is nearly two-_and-a-half_ hours."
