    One of my favorite action tropes is when a extraordinarily capable protagonist is made to work _really really_ hard to succeed, with the screws turned on them as hard as possible, just to see them sweat and exercise their experience.
    
    And boy does _The Dark Knight_ use a high-torque impact wrench on those screws. This movie has the Joker beat up on Batman so badly that the world's greatest detective seems hapless and fumbling. I mean, the Joker is so ahead of Batman that an ending where Batman actually triumphs seems unbelievable. (Of course, the plot does get there.)
    
    Unfortunately, the Two Face part of the movie feels like a forth act of a three-act play to me: it might be a complete arc, but it also feels like a lesser, rushed part of a greater movie. But even the lackluster fourth act can't diminish Heath Ledger's performance that provides us the greatest villain in all of movies. Yes, even better than Darth Vader and Liberty Valance.
