  title: "Interstellar",
  text: `I love the scope and science-based imagination of _Interstellar_, even if I barely understand the time- and mind-bending finale. Nolan is a brainy guy with an eye for the technical, and him tackling the material conceptualized by physicist Kip Thorn was a perfect match. (_Interstellar_ was originally supposed to be a Spielberg film. That would've been probably good for very different reasons.)
          
          What I don't love is a script that often feels contrived and clumsy, with whole sections of exposition, of both the human and cosmological kind, that feel stiff and obligatory. The example I remember the most is the fault of poor Anne Hathaway, who is otherwise fine in this movie, but who delivers a monologue about human love and attraction that is notable not for its life-affirming intent but how wooden and conspicuous it is. And then there's the tying-off of threads that reunites (in a way) father and daughter, a fundamental character finale that lands poorly, in a movie that otherwise lands dozens of complicated science-oriented concepts and plot points. There is a lot in _Interstellar_ that has little oomph.
          
          But in the end, I watch _Interstellar_ to see some cool happenings out in space, away from Earth, and watch humans struggle against literal time and tide(s), to which it delivers mightly. It has Matthew McConaughey delivering a warm, natural performance in the cold dead of space. It has robots that seem blocky and rigid but reveal complexity at just the right wondrous moments. And this movie has [one of my favorite action sequences of all time, the docking to the damaged _Endurance._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onVhbeY7nLM)`,
