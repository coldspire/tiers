  "text": "Watching _Tenet_ didn't happen until well beyond it's released in the COVID-19-draped summer of 2020 for two reasons: the aforementioned COVID-19 outbreak, which, in a world which did not yet have vaccines for the epidemic, made going to a public movie theater about as appealing as floating face-down in a bubbling swamp; and because I'd heard the movie was an incomprehensible, unfollowable mess. Which, hey, those are pretty good reasons to avoid hitting the local multiplex for a movie, even if it's the latest by a favorite director.\n\nJump ahead a couple years, and I figured that if I picked up _Tenet_ on Blu-ray, I could watch and re-watch bits as much as possible to understand what was going on. Or if it did turn out to be a muddling fiasco, I could ditch it entirely from the comfort of my own home, at least.\n\nThe ranking speaks for itself: after a couple viewings, which did indeed involve multiple rewatches of key segments, _Tenet_ has become one of my favorite Nolan movies."
