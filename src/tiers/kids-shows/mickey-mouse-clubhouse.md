A big part of the appeal of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is its simplicity and the problem-solving-plots formula. I mean, there's also the bright colors, the cheerful demeanor, and the goofy-silly Disney crew. But Clubhouse is so straight-forward and genuine that this show is much more enjoyable than any of the manic Mouse shows that followed it. Visually it's a little clunky and stiff — this was a preschooler-focused Disney Junior show from the mid-2000s after all, so no technical showcase to be found here — but the stories and presentation improve in fidelity and detail as the show seasons go on. In the early seasons, Daisy needs help finding her lost sheep; in the later seasons, there are two-parter riffs where the crew visits the "Wizard of Dizz" and rocket around space to collect stars. 

I have good memories watching this show when visiting my oldest sister and her young son in the 2000s. Now it's 2024, and I enjoy watching this show with my own young kids.
