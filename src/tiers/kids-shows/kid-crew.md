The Kids Doing Things Forever genre is another one of those rampant YouTube genres that, at best, is nearly pure white-sugar content. Children drive around in electric mini-vehicles, gesticulating widely, mugging open-mouthed for their frequent close-ups. Open-library sound effects blast out to accompany every movement and action, no matter how small. The unending background music is halfway between a low-rank-superhero entrance motif and the theme song of a long-forgotten 80s cartoon serial. Usually one or more parental figures frequently leap into the frame to bray at the audience and further the threadbare plot, reminding the audience that the children aren't the only ones worked to the bone for the dream of a million views. Throughout the duration, no emotion is evoked from the viewer, except stupification. And once over, there is no memory of the video, as there is nothing of worth to remember.

Then there's [Kid Crew](https://www.youtube.com/@kidcrew), a genuinely funny, warm, adventurous, homespun example of the genre. A family of three play-works and work-plays in their comfortable backyard and the woods beyond. They utilize an enviable fleet of miniature electric vehicles to perform make-believe scenarios, such as putting out fires (which is composed of red, orange, and yellow tissue paper) and mounting a mom-rescue operation by a tiny creek within the trees. Interspersed between scenarios are "Here's How It Works!" segments performed by the dad, brief and tidy presentations on how, well, a thing works. And over the top of it all, the mom of the Kid Crew power trio brings us along with the antics as our cheerful, comfortable narrator.

After watching many Kid Crew videos – when you have kids interested in a thing, you tend to take in a *lot* of that thing, and the laser focus was fixed on Kid Crew for a couple weeks – gradually understand that this is a blue-collar working family, with a farming business outside the margin of the videos. The backyard chicken coup is a big hint. Another big tell are the multiple demonstrations on the kid's electric vehicles being augmented with additional machinery – they add actual working street-sweeper brushes to one car! And a garbage-truck lifting arm to another! – and shows off the family's mechanical know-how and grit. 

And you know what? Not a sound effect to be heard throughout.
