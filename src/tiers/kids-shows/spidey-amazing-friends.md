So here's where I write about my annoyance with the standard children's episodic format, which has gone something like this since time immemorial[^1]: 

1. The protagonists and friends are engaged in an activity to set up the plot at large
2. A villain or situation disrupts or pulls the protagonists away from the activity in step 1
3. The crew attempts to stop the villainy but runs into one or two minor obstacles. The villain temporarily gains the upper hand
4. The crew gets it together and subdues the villain
5. The activity in step 1 is resumed
6. To end the episode, a character says something funny or clever so everyone can laugh together as the screen fades to black

So, all in all, this Spidey show is fine. It's _fine_. This is not a bad show in the way that shows can be bad, especially when you compare it to all the cheap user-made garbage on YouTube or something like the pandering brainless hairball that is Disney's own SuperKitties.

But Spidey bugs me. It doesn't bug me because it adheres to The Formula, which is the Hero's Journey 4 Kidz. It doesn't bug me because the show has a dull and lifeless presentation in spite of its bright colors, exaggerated character proportions, and playful banter. It doesn't bug me because I'm not a comic fan and was tired of the glut of comics content that dominated pop culture over the last decade-plus. Or the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Spidey bugs me because somehow my brain has convinced itself that Disney, a company that is fully capable of well-done stories and good compelling visuals, regardless of its audience, still puts out shows like this. 

Is that fair? Probably not. 

But it still bugs me.
