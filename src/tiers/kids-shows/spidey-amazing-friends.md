This show is, by all measures, just fine. It's _fine_. This is not a bad show in the way that shows can be bad, especially when you compare it to all the cheap user-made garbage on YouTube or Disney's own SuperKitties.

But this is a show that _bugs_ me. And the thing that bugs me about this show is how lazy it is. Here is the formula:
1. Peter Parker/Spiderman and friends are engaged in an activity to set up the plot at large. _We are smart, fun-loving kids doing a thing._
2. A villain disrupts or pulls the protagonists away from the activity in step 1. _No peace or fun allowed!_
3. The crew attempts to stop the villainy but runs into one or two minor obstacles when the villain has the upper hand! _Oh no!_
4. The crew gets it together and subdues the villain! _We did it, gang!_
5. The activity in step 1 is resumed. _Remember how we loved being smart and fun?_
6. And to end the episode, a character speaks a _bon mot_ so everyone can laugh together as the screen fades to black. _Isn't it all funny-fun in the end?_

To be sure, seemingly 90% of shows for the age demographic of preschoolers through, say, late teenagers — so, yeah, basically all of childhood — follow this formula. Spidey and His Amazing Friends is just the one show of this type that my kids watched the most, so it bothered me the most.

OK, so _why_ does this show bug me so much? Because it features some of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world standing on top of Disney's broad shoulders, and it takes the easiest route to tell a story. XXXXXXXXXXXXx

Do I expect anything else from Disney making a show at this level for this age group? No, not really. And yet somehow my brain has convinced itself that a company that is fully capable, in all of the resources that matter, of well-done stories and good compelling visuals should always reach a high bar, regardless of its audience. Obviously that's not the way it goes and hasn't gone that way for a long time.

But it still bugs me.
