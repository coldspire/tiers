I remember when a neighborhood parent suggested the show "Stinky & Dirty," full title being "The Stinky & Dirty Show." Uh, yuck? I mean, what's in a name, a rose would smell as sweet, and all that, right? But at the same time, that show just sounds gross.

Surprise: I was wrong. Not only was I wrong, but I was _really_ wrong. The Stinky & Dirty Show is one of my favorite kids shows. Turns out the "Stinky" of the title is a garbage truck. And "Dirty," Stinky's best friend, is a backhoe loader. It's a show about talking vehicles in Go City who help each other solve problems in clever ways. 

This show has one of my favorite scenes in all of kid-showdom. Stinky and Dirty are attempting to ascend a road going up a hill to reach their friend Chill, an ice-cream truck handing out snow cones. Halfway up the hill, they reach a stopping point; while attempting to figure out how to scale the rest of the icy road, Chill begins playing the song "The Sno Cone Shuffle" (remember, he's an ice cream truck). Stinky and Dirty grin at each other as the song starts, and they begin singing the words and dancing along. Hearing this song was what caught the characters' attention for snow cones initially, so the Shuffle music with singing and dancing is a refrain throughout the episode. But in this particular moment, there's something so genuine and warm about Stinky and Dirty taking a break from their uphill quest to sing and dance along to a simple melodious tune emanating from the ice cream truck[^1].

I mean, kids shows just _don't_ have moments like that. Most shows are so busy. So busy with their characters keeping their hands and bodies constantly in motion, getting in and out of manufactured trouble and ending up telling each other how good friendship is and all that. But over here in Go City, there are actual moments of characters interacting and playing off each other, not just moving along a plot in motion. This is a show about a backhoe talking to a garbage truck, and I, an adult on the far side of middle age, _enjoys what they are talking about_.

And as names go, when I hear my kids want to watch "Stinky and Dirty," nothing sounds sweeter.
