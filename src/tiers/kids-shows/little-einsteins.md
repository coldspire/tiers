An episode of Little Einsteins brings a lot to the table. 2D- and 3D-animated characters commingling on 2D- and 3D- drawn backgrounds. Classical art and music pieces and snippets woven into plots that involve talking animals and traveling the world in a bright red transformable vehicle named Rocket. Bookends presenting each episode as a stage production, complete with curtain call. XXXXXXXXXXX. How does it all work?

Who cares? It works. Sure, if you look at the individual pieces, this is one seriously oddly-put-together show. But if you just, y'know, _watch it_, it's delightful.
