The latest entry to the tiers is on its face a bizarre mash-up of visual design, presentation, plot, and education delivery mechanisms. The main characters and backgrounds are 2D animation, but the kids' friend and transformable vehicle Rocket is fully 3D animated, as are many of the secondary characters. Each episode features different pieces of art and music, a lot of it classical, but the pieces are integrated into plots where a singing animal friend is being saved or a distant locale is visited for food. Each episode is bookended by the curtain on a stage opening and closing, as if the ongoings are a stage production, but this framing never factors into the plot. 

But it works! If you look at the individual pieces, this is one seriously oddly-put-together show. But if you just, y'know, _watch it_, it's delightful. A large part of why I like Little Einsteins is its constant use of music. The music goes beyond whatever piece of music it chooses to spotlight during the episode: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
