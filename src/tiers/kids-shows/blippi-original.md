My problem with the original[^1] Blippi is not that the character is a man child. I one-hundred-percent don't use that term in a derogatory way, as that's the role: Blippi is an adult man dressed in orange-and-blue clothing and accessories with expressive, intentional child-like wonder of the world and an insatiable desire to play and learn. Which I think could be great for kids to watch! Actual young children in the same role may have genuine reactions, but they _actually_ want to play, not poke and demonstrate and drive the play like an older actor can. You need someone older to shovel the learning content with direction and intent onto the actual younger audience, all the while keeping them compelled and watching. So the man-child act is where the compelling comes in.

My problem with Blippi is that he is bad at what he does.

To Blippi, any thing can be and regularly is "awesome." Blippi makes a frequent point to say how much he love vegetables and always describes them as "tasty." Everyone is his friend, and sometimes his best friend, regardless of how long he's known them. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

These are not feelings or ways to describe the world. They are clich√©s.

I don't care about Blippi's odd noises and dances and strange mannerisms. I think these things are totally fine, and maybe even good, as part of the character. My kids have watched and will watch way more childish stuff. But if I'm handing over my kids' screen time to someone, XXXXXXXXXXXXX


[^1]: Since Blippi's inception, a second Blippi-playing actor periodically dons the orange-and-blue beret. This understudy is better than the original Blippi in every way: all of my complaints about Blippi Prime are avoided by the secondary Blippi. Unfortunately, the original Blippi still makes the majority of appearances, as well as living forever in the massive archives. I originally had a separate tier for secondary Blippi (rank C), but I decided I didn't have the time nor energy for two Blippi entries.
