When I try to describe Bluey to non-watchers, I've tried comparing it to the all-timer newspaper comic "Calvin and Hobbes." Unfortunately I'm finding that this comparison isn't landing as well as I've hoped, given that Calvin and Hobbes ended in 1995, almost 30 years ago as of this writing. So I'll try to describe Bluey in precise language:

Gorgeously drawn, colored, and animated. Boundless and unconstrained. Effortlessly playful and inventive, though seriously so. Lushly scored and spoken. And incredibly thoughtful. 

And yet it's still a show for kids, through and through. But also a show for all ages.

Bluey has a show about dads pulling up tree stumps and children building nail salons ("Stumpfest"). It has an episode that merges a dreamworld in space with the ongoing real-world reality of parents putting sleepy children to bed ("Sleepytime"). And an episode that combines the theory of evolution and building IKEA-like furniture ("Flat Pack"). And one about children reliving trauma, which it handles perfectly gracefully ("Space"). One about the simple but magical natural pleasures of going to the beach ("The Beach").

And then Bluey has _150 more episodes_. For me there is _a single episode_ that falls kinda flat: "Tickle Crabs." And it's still a fine episode overall! One episode out of 154 is a sorta-dud!

I'm not sure even Calvin and Hobbes had that quality of run.
