Let's get something clear about these kids-shows tiers: These rankings solely represent the opinions of _me_, a forty-something parent. As for the kids' opinions, I did not even entertain the idea of factoring in their thoughts here.

Besides, if I quizzed my four-year-olds[^1] on their own rankings, any show is a stratospheric S-tier banger during the period when they are laser-focused on watching that show and that show alone. And when the show isn't the flavor of the week, they'd still probably A-rank it. Heck, if any show reached B-rank for them, I'd actually be genuinely interested why it ranked so low. Then we'd probably have a whole conversation why the ranks start with "S" and not "A".

So any complaints herein are only in the mind of the adult who usually sits and watches cartoons with his kids. For the kids themselves, it's all solid gold.

[^1]: Four years old at the time of writing, October 2024. We also have a five-month-old, but she doesn't have much to say of anything yet. But she is super cute.
